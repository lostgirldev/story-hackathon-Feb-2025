## Story Implementation Report
Based on the codebase provided and the Story Protocol documentation, here's a report analyzing the project's implementation of Story Protocol features:

## Story Protocol Implementation Analysis

### Summary

The provided codebase **does not implement any Story Protocol features**. It makes no reference to the Story Protocol SDK, nor imports any packages from the `@story-protocol/core-sdk` dependency.

### Detailed Analysis

1.  **Absence of `@story-protocol/core-sdk` import**:
    *   A key indicator for Story Protocol usage is the import of the SDK.  No files contain `import from "@story-protocol/core-sdk"` or similar statements.

2.  **Missing Key Feature Implementations**:
    *   **IP Asset Registration:** No functions or code sections responsible for registering NFTs as IP Assets.
    *   **Programmable IP Licenses (PIL):** No evidence of PIL creation, attachment, or usage.
    *   **License Tokens:** No license token minting or management.
    *   **Royalty Module:** No code dealing with royalty distribution, revenue sharing, or royalty vaults.
    *   **Dispute Module:** No functions for raising or handling IP Asset disputes.
    *    **SPG (Periphery)** No functions to handle batch transactions.
    *   **Hooks:** There are no hooks or modules implemented in the code.

3.  **Overall Codebase Quality (Story Protocol Perspective)**
    *   Given the complete absence of Story Protocol features, it's not possible to evaluate the codebase quality in terms of Story Protocol best practices, proper SDK usage, or adherence to its architectural principles.

### Conclusion

The codebase does not include any Story Protocol functionality.
