### Bug Report

The following issues were found in the codebase:

1.  **Incorrect Chain ID in `scripts/viem-goat.ts`:**

    ```typescript
    const walletClient = createWalletClient({
    	account,
    	transport: http(process.env.RPC_PROVIDER_URL),
    	chain: base,
    });
    ```

    **Problem:** The code hardcodes the `chain` to `base`.  This implies the application is intended to only operate on the Base chain. The prompt provided at the end of the file is for Arbitrum chain (`42161`) and chain id `10` for destination chain, which is Optimism. Thus, the script, as is, is not chain-agnostic as implied in the comments and will only ever work on the Base chain, causing potential errors when attempting operations on other chains. This is a violation to the prompt at the end which asks to operate with Arbitrum and Optimism.
2.  **Unsafe Type Casting in `scripts/viem-goat.ts`:**

    ```typescript
    wallet: viem(walletClient as any),
    ```

    **Problem:** Casting `walletClient` to `any` circumvents type checking, potentially leading to runtime errors if the `viem` function expects a specific type.
3.  **Missing Error Handling in `scripts/dydx/example.ts`:**

    ```typescript
          const tx = await client.placeOrder(
            subaccount,
            market,
            type,
            side,
            price,
            size,
            clientId,
            timeInForce,
            goodTilTimeInSeconds1,
            execution,
            postOnly,
            reduceOnly,
          );
          console.log('**Order Tx**');
          console.log(tx);
        } catch (error) {
          // console.log(error.message);
        }
    ```

    ```typescript
          const tx = await client.cancelOrder(
            subaccount,
            clientId,
            orderFlags,
            market,
            goodTillBlock,
            goodTillTimeInSeconds2,
          );
          console.log('**Cancel Order Tx**');
          console.log(tx);

        } catch (error) {
          // console.log(error.message);
        }
    ```

    **Problem:** The `try...catch` blocks that wrap `client.placeOrder` and `client.cancelOrder` methods, the `console.log(error.message)` is commented. This prevents the code from properly handling and logging errors that may occur when placing or cancelling an order, making it harder to debug issues.
4.  **Hardcoded Order Parameters in `scripts/dydx/example.ts`:**

    ```typescript
        const market = 'BTC-USD';
        const size = 0.01;
    ```

    **Problem:**  The `market` and `size` const are hardcoded, ignoring parameters defined in the `ordersParams` json file. This limits the script's flexibility and prevents it from processing different orders as intended. `price` and `type` also appear to not be properly extracted from the json object, but those might just work.

5.  **Missing API Key in `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`:**

    ```typescript
    {
      headers: {
        "x-cg-demo-api-key": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_KEY || ""
      }
    }
    ```

    **Problem:**: Using demo api key, if the volume is high, this would break. Add instructions on how to get an API key for coingecko. Also, the prices and balances are fetched every 30 seconds, which can be costly if many users are using the platform.

6.  **Potentially unused code in `src/config/appkit.ts`:**

    ```typescript
    // Initialize LiFi SDK with Wagmi integration
    // createLifiConfig({
    //   integrator: "OxwellAI",
    //   providers: [
    //     EVM({
    //       getWalletClient: () => getWalletClient(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig),
    //       switchChain: async (chainId) => {
    //         const chain = await switchChain(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig, { chainId: chainId })
    //         return getWalletClient(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig, { chainId: chain.id })
    //       },
    //     }),
    //   ],
    //   preloadChains: false,
    // })
    ```

    **Problem:** The code is commented out, but it may be used in the future. If the Lifi SDK is needed, the code should be uncommented.

## Readme vs Code Report
```markdown
## Analysis of Documentation/README Implementation in Codebase

This analysis compares the provided documentation/README with the codebase to determine the extent of implementation and identify missing parts.

### Implemented Features

*   **Support Natural Language:** The codebase extensively uses natural language processing (NLP) via the `ai` library and OpenAI's models (e.g., gpt-4o).  The `scripts/debridge.ts` and `scripts/viem-goat.ts` scripts demonstrate the parsing of natural language prompts and execution of actions based on them.  The `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` serves as an API endpoint that handles chat interactions and uses the `ai` library to process user messages and generate responses.

*   **Instructions - Fill env with your own keys:** The code relies on environment variables such as `PRIVATE_KEY`, `RPC_PROVIDER_URL`, `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `COINGECKO_API_KEY`. The `scripts/debridge.ts`, `scripts/viem-goat.ts`, `src/config/appkit.ts`, `src/lib/tools/index.ts`, and `src/lib/tools/dydx-tools.ts` files all access these variables, confirming that the setup requires configuring environment variables. The `.env` file usage is mentioned explicitly in `scripts/debridge.ts`.

*   **Instructions - run `bun dev`:** While not explicitly stated in the code, the presence of `tailwind.config.ts`, `next.config.ts`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, and `src/app/page.tsx` suggest a Next.js project. The `bun dev` command is a common command used to start a Next.js application, which is assumed in the context of this codebase.

*   **`get token info for DBRiDgJAMsM95moTzJs7M9LnkGErpbv9v6CUR1DXnUu5 on chainid 7565164` prompt:** The `getTokenByChain` tool within `src/goat/lifi.plugin.ts` addresses this. It fetches token information using the provided chain ID and token address.

*   **`get supported chains` prompt:** The `getChainInfo` tool in `src/goat/lifi.plugin.ts` is designed to return information about supported chains.

*   **`get bridge quote from ...` and `create bridge order from ...` prompts:** The `getQuote` and `executeRoute` tools in `src/goat/lifi.plugin.ts` are designed to handle these prompts, facilitating the retrieval of bridge quotes and the execution of bridge orders.

*   **`Check tx status for 0x1871db50cd129229918d6f9b06232255a1c8a611ebe083e2a1b14215d2b0c0a4` prompt:** Although no specific tool is dedicated to transaction status checking, the `executeRoute` tool in `src/goat/lifi.plugin.ts` provides route updates, implying a mechanism for monitoring transaction progress, even though a dedicated checker is missing.

### Missing or Partially Implemented Features

*   **Real Execution Prompt:** The prompt includes the phrase `and execute it`. While the code includes functionality to execute routes (`executeRoute` in `src/goat/lifi.plugin.ts`), there's no explicit logic to automatically trigger the execution after a quote is obtained. The user interface or a more sophisticated NLP interpretation would be needed to fully implement this.

*   **`create bridge order from base with native token with amount 0.001 to arbitrum with native token and recipient same as sender` prompt:**
    *   **Native Token Handling:** There's logic within `src/goat/lifi.plugin.ts` to use `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` as the address for native tokens.
    *   **"Recipient same as sender":** The code doesn't automatically infer the recipient address is same as the sender.  It would require additional logic within the prompt parsing or tool execution to utilize the wallet's address as the recipient.
    *   Amount interpretation as 0.001 ETH : There is an `getAmountWithDecimals` tools but it doesnt parse amount amount directly from the natural language input.

*   **`create bridge order from 0.23 CAKE on Base chain to USDC on Arbitrum, the recipient same as sender` prompt:**
    *   **Token Symbol Resolution:** The code has `convertTokenSymbolToTokenAddress` in `src/lib/tools/index.ts` to look up token addresses from symbols.
    *   The issue of  **"Recipient same as sender"** is not implemented.

*   **Perp Integration**: The documentation mentions Perp Integration as a feature, but there is no mention of any code related to Perp or Perpetual Protocol in the provided codebase.

*   **Balance Checking**: While `src/app/api/balance/route.ts` and `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` implement balance checking, it is currently limited in scope. It focuses on native tokens and requires the wallet address and chain ID to be explicitly provided, there isn't direct tool to check balance based on token symbol.

*   **Error Handling & User Feedback:** While the `getError` tool exists in the `lifi.plugin.ts`, there is no clear implementation to handle errors within the prompt execution.
*   **Confirmation:** The system prompt in `scripts/debridge.ts` mentions to always ask for confirmation before proceeding with a transaction, but that is not a tool or any other explicit implementation to actually do it.

### Summary

The codebase implements the core functionality described in the README, especially regarding natural language processing, chain and token information retrieval, and bridge quote generation/execution.  However, certain aspects, particularly regarding real execution flow, implicit parameter resolution (recipient = sender), amount parsing, confirmation requests, and error handling, require further development to align fully with the documentation.

## Story Implementation Report
```markdown
## Story Protocol Implementation Report

This report assesses the implementation of the Story Protocol within the provided codebase. The assessment focuses on the presence and quality of Story Protocol features, proper import usage, and overall code quality.

### Project Overview

The project appears to be a Web3 trading agent that helps users execute tasks across multiple blockchains through natural language interactions. It leverages AI and various DeFi protocols and SDKs to enable cross-chain token swaps, asset bridging, and portfolio management.

### Story Protocol Feature Implementation

Based on the provided codebase and documentation, there is **no direct implementation** of the Story Protocol's core IP asset management features (IP Asset Registration, Programmable IP Licenses, Royalty Module, Dispute Module, Grouping Module, Hooks, and Story Protocol Gateway). There is no usage of `@story-protocol/core-sdk` or similar packages related to Story Protocol.

However, the application does share some conceptual similarities and can be extended to leverage Story Protocol in the future:

*   **IP Asset Representation:** The project deals with digital assets (tokens) across different blockchains, which conceptually aligns with Story Protocol's management of on-chain IP assets.
*   **Licensing (Future Potential):**  While not implemented, the project could integrate PILs for trading strategies or AI models used by the agent.
*   **Revenue Sharing (Future Potential):**  The trading agent's profit-sharing mechanisms with users could be formalized using Story Protocol's royalty modules.

### Codebase Quality Regarding Story Protocol

*   **No Direct Implementation:** As mentioned, the codebase lacks any direct implementation of Story Protocol features or SDKs.
*   **Potential for Integration:** The project's architecture, which uses plugins and tools for interacting with different protocols, could be extended to include Story Protocol functionalities as a separate module.
*   **Dependency Management:** The project uses `dotenv` for managing environment variables, which can be used to store Story Protocol related API keys and contract addresses if the protocol were to be implemented.
*   **Modularity:** The project is well-structured with logical separation of concerns (e.g., components, UI elements, custom hooks), making it easier to introduce new modules without impacting existing code.

### Recommendations

To leverage Story Protocol, the project could consider the following:

*   **IP Asset Registration:** If the trading strategies or AI models used by the agent are considered IP, register them as IP Assets on Story Protocol.
*   **Licensing:** Use PILs to define terms for commercial use of the agent's trading strategies, particularly if they are shared or licensed to other users.
*   **Royalty Module:** Implement revenue sharing with users using Story Protocol's royalty modules, ensuring transparent and automated distribution of profits.

### Conclusion

The codebase currently **does not implement** any Story Protocol features directly. However, the project's modular design and focus on on-chain assets provide a solid foundation for future integration with the Story Protocol ecosystem. The project could benefit from using Story Protocol to manage the licensing and revenue sharing of the trading strategies it uses.
