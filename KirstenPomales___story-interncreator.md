### Bug Report

The `cli.ts` file in the `packages/tunnel` directory uses `tsx` via `pnpm dlx` to execute `src/tunnels.ts`. However, it directly requires the `src/tunnels.ts` file rather than using a proper module import.

**Problematic Code:**

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env -S pnpm dlx tsx

require("./src/tunnels.ts").withTunnel();
```

**Explanation:**

The `require` statement bypasses the TypeScript compiler. While `tsx` is used to *execute* this file, the `require` statement itself doesn't involve `tsx` or any other compiler.  This is problematic because:

1.  **TypeScript Type Checking is Ignored:** The `require` statement simply includes the JavaScript output (if it exists). If `src/tunnels.ts` has TypeScript errors, they will not be caught during this phase.
2.  **Unexpected Behavior in Non-Compiled Environments:** If the project hasn't been built, and only the TypeScript files exist, `require("./src/tunnels.ts")` will either fail (if `ts-node` or similar isn't globally installed), or it may include outdated/incorrect JavaScript (if an older build exists).
3.  **`pnpm dlx tsx` is Circumvented:** The whole point of using `pnpm dlx tsx` is to execute the file using `tsx` which handles TypeScript compilation, but the `require` statement circumvents this process.

**How to Fix:**

Use a proper module import.  The corrected `cli.ts` should look like this:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env -S pnpm dlx tsx

import { withTunnel } from "./src/tunnels.ts";

withTunnel();
```

By using an `import` statement, `tsx` (invoked by `pnpm dlx`) will correctly compile and execute the TypeScript file, enabling type checking and ensuring that the code is up-to-date.  This also aligns with the project's overall architecture of using TypeScript.

## Readme vs Code Report

## Documentation/README Analysis for story-interncreator

Based on the provided documentation and codebase, here's an analysis of the implementation:

**1. Documentation Completeness:**

The provided README is extremely minimal. It only contains the project name, "story-interncreator" and some decorative "======" lines. It offers absolutely no information about the project's purpose, setup instructions, usage, features, or architecture. Therefore, it is almost impossible to assess how much of the *intended* functionality is implemented since the intended functionality is unknown.

**2. Implemented Features (Inferred from Code):**

Based on the code, it *appears* that the project is a web application, potentially built with Next.js, that allows users to create and configure an "AI marketing intern," likely for managing social media accounts (specifically, Twitter/X).

Here's a breakdown of the implemented features based on the file contents:

*   **Website:** The `packages/website` directory contains the code for a marketing website and a multi-step form.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. (`tailwind.config.ts`)
    *   **Next.js:**  The `next.config.ts` and file structure indicate a Next.js project.
    *   **Layout:** The `src/app/layout.tsx` file defines the root layout, including fonts, metadata (title, description, icons), and a private beta banner.
    *   **Homepage:** The `src/app/page.tsx` seems to define the structure of the homepage, utilizing components like `Header`, `Hero`, `Features`, `FeaturesSection`, `Callout`, `Faq`, `Newcta`, and `Footer`. However, most components on the homepage seem to be commented out.
    *   **Multi-Step Form:** The `src/app/form/page.tsx` file implements a multi-step form with components for each step: `StepZero`, `StepOne`, `StepTwo`, `StepThree`, `StepFour`, and `StepFive`.  This form collects user input to configure the "intern."
    *   **Components:**  The `src/components` directory contains various UI components:
        *   `Header`, `Footer`, `Hero`, `FeaturesSection`, `Callout`, `Faq`, `NewCta` (likely for the homepage)
        *   `PrivateBetaBanner` (a banner to indicate a private beta)
        *   `TestimonialCard`, `PricingCard`, `SmallFeatureCard` (reusable UI elements)
        *   `NavItem`, `MobileNavItem`, `MobileNavbar` (navigation components)
        *   UI primitives from `src/components/ui` (card, accordion, badge, separator, button)

*   **Tunneling:** The `packages/tunnel` directory provides a command-line interface (`cli.ts`) and code (`src/tunnels.ts`) to establish a tunnel using Cloudflared. This suggests that the project allows users to expose their local development environment to the internet.

**3. Missing/Unimplemented Features (Inferred from Code and Assumptions):**

Given the project's apparent purpose and the code available, here's a list of potential missing/unimplemented features:

*   **Backend Logic:**  The code mainly focuses on the frontend and UI components.  There's no evident backend code for:
    *   Handling form submissions (the `handleSubmit` function in `src/app/form/page.tsx` only logs the form data).
    *   Creating and managing the "AI intern" instances.
    *   Connecting to social media APIs (Twitter/X).
    *   Implementing the AI logic for the intern's behavior (posting, replying, etc.).
    *   Minting NFTs (mentioned in `StepThree.tsx`).
    *   Data persistence (saving the intern's configuration).
*   **Authentication:** There's no explicit authentication system in place. Step Four's login functionality may be a placeholder.
*   **Pricing Logic:** While there's a `Pricing` component, the waitlist link suggests this hasn't been fully implemented.
*   **Image Generation:** Automatic image generation is mentioned as "coming soon."
*   **Social Media Integration:** The core functionality of the "intern" (managing social media accounts) seems largely unimplemented. The X login in Step Four appears basic, with no actual API calls.
*   **Error Handling and Validation:**  The form components lack robust input validation and error handling.
*   **Accessibility:**  While Tailwind CSS can be used to create accessible components, a thorough accessibility review is likely needed.
*   **Testing:**  No unit or integration tests are included in the provided code snippets.
*   **Proper Documentation:** As noted initially, a comprehensive README and code comments are completely missing.

**4. Summary:**

The codebase represents a work-in-progress. The frontend UI appears to be reasonably well-developed, providing a user interface to configure a virtual intern.  However, the core backend logic, AI functionality, social media integration, and many other essential components are missing or incomplete.  The complete lack of documentation makes it difficult to precisely assess the extent of missing features.

## Story Implementation Report
```markdown
## Story Protocol Implementation Report for The Intern Website

This report analyzes the codebase of "The Intern" website project to determine the extent and quality of its integration with the Story Protocol.

**Summary:**

The codebase contains some UI text referencing Story Protocol and its concepts, particularly around IP asset creation for the AI interns. However, there is no actual implementation of the Story Protocol's SDK or any of its core functionalities within the provided codebase. Thus, the features around the Story Protocol are not implemented.

**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. Feature Implementation:**

Based on the provided Story Protocol documentation and tutorials, the following features could potentially be implemented in a project like "The Intern":

*   **IP Asset Registration:**  Creating an IP Asset for each AI intern.
*   **License Management:** Defining and attaching licenses to the AI intern's generated content (e.g., terms of use, commercial rights).
*   **Royalty Management:** If the AI intern's content generates revenue, distributing royalties to the intern's owner.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Implementing a mechanism to handle disputes related to the AI intern's IP.

**Actual Implementation:**

The provided codebase **does not implement any** of these Story Protocol features. While there's a `StepThree` component (`src/app/form/components/StepThree.tsx`) that mentions "Intellectual Property" and "Give Your Intern Ownership" linking to Story Protocol, it's just UI text with no corresponding code to interact with the Story Protocol SDK or any smart contracts.  The StepThree Component contains the following UI:

```tsx
 <div className="text-sm font-bold uppercase tracking-wide text-blue-600">
        Intellectual Property
      </div>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold sm:text-3xl">Give Your Intern Ownership</h2>
      <p className=" font-bold">
        Each intern has their personality stored an IP Asset on Story Protocol, via a custom NFT.
        This enables your Intern to both own their personality, but also all of the content that
        they generate on X.{" "}
      </p>

      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={onNext}
        className="rounded bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-blue-600"
      >
        Mint NFT & IP Asset
      </button>
```

Clicking the "Mint NFT & IP Asset" button only moves the form forward, without triggering any on-chain interactions related to Story Protocol.

**2. Code Quality & Correctness:**

*   **Missing "@story-protocol/core-sdk" Import:** There are no import statements for `@story-protocol/core-sdk` anywhere in the codebase. This is the primary indicator that the Story Protocol SDK is not being used.
*   **No SDK Usage:**  Functions like `client.ipAsset.register()`, `client.license.attachLicenseTerms()`, or `client.royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf()` are nowhere to be found. The "form" functionality stops at collecting user input; there's no backend logic to translate that input into Story Protocol interactions.

**3. General Report:**

The codebase's integration with Story Protocol is **non-existent**. The UI suggests an intention to integrate, but the project lacks any actual code implementation.  The current state of the codebase presents a misleading impression to users, as it implies IP ownership and Story Protocol integration without providing any of the underlying functionality.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Install the SDK:** Begin by installing the Story Protocol SDK: `npm install @story-protocol/core-sdk`.

2.  **Implement IP Asset Registration:** In `StepThree.tsx` (or a dedicated API route), use the SDK's `client.ipAsset.register()` or `client.ipAsset.mintAndRegisterIp()` functions to register an IP Asset when the user clicks the "Mint NFT & IP Asset" button.  Use the data gathered from `StepOne.tsx` to generate the `IpMetadata` object required by the `register` function.

3.  **Consider License Terms:** Decide what license terms apply to the AI intern's content and implement `client.license.attachLicenseTerms()` accordingly.

4.  **Address Security:** The current `StepFour.tsx` component, which captures X login credentials, poses significant security risks and should not be implemented in production.  If the AI intern needs to post on X, consider using the X API and OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.  *Never* store user passwords directly.

5.  **Clarify UI:** Remove or modify the UI elements that suggest Story Protocol integration until the actual implementation is in place. It is crucial to manage user expectations and avoid misleading claims.

In conclusion, while the UI hints at Story Protocol integration, the codebase currently lacks any functional implementation of Story Protocol features. Addressing this requires adding the SDK, implementing the relevant API calls, and carefully considering security implications.
