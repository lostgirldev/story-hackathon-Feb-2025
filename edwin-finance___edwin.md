### Bug Report

The following issues were identified in the provided codebase:

1.  **Inconsistent Type for `amount` in Jupiter Swap Tool Schema**: The `amount` property in the `jupiterSwap` tool schema in `src/plugins/jupiter/jupiterPlugin.ts` is defined as `z.number().positive()`. However, the `amount` property in `SwapParameters` interface defined in `src/plugins/jupiter/parameters.ts` is a string.

    ```typescript
    // src/plugins/jupiter/jupiterPlugin.ts
                schema: z.object({
                    asset: z.string().min(1),
                    assetB: z.string().min(1),
                    amount: z.number().positive(),
                }),
    // src/plugins/jupiter/parameters.ts
    export interface SwapParameters {
        asset: string;
        assetB: string;
        amount: string;
    }
    ```

    **Problem:** This type mismatch will cause validation errors when the `jupiterSwap` tool is executed, as it expects a number but receives a string.

    **Solution:**  Change the schema definition to `z.string().min(1)` to align with the `SwapParameters` interface.

2.  **Inconsistent Type for `chain` in Aave Supply Tool Schema**: The `chain` property in the `aaveSupply` tool schema in `src/plugins/aave/aavePlugin.ts` is defined as `z.string().min(1)`. However, the `chain` property in `SupplyParameters` interface defined in `src/plugins/aave/parameters.ts` is of type `SupportedChain`.

    ```typescript
    // src/plugins/aave/aavePlugin.ts
                schema: z.object({
                    chain: z.string().min(1),
                    asset: z.string().min(1),
                    amount: z.number().positive(),
                }),
    // src/plugins/aave/parameters.ts
    import { SupportedChain } from '../../core/types';

    export interface SupplyParameters {
        chain: SupportedChain;
        asset: string;
        amount: number;
    }
    ```

    **Problem:** This type mismatch will cause validation errors when the `aaveSupply` tool is executed, as it expects a string but receives a `SupportedChain` object.

    **Solution:** Either change the schema definition to align with the `SupplyParameters` interface, or convert the input type to `string` before executing it. The first solution will be more robust.

3.  **Missing `apikey` argument at `new CookiePlugin()` in `src/client/edwin.ts`**

    ```typescript
            if (process.env.COOKIE_API_KEY) {
                this.plugins.cookie = cookie(process.env.COOKIE_API_KEY);
            }
    ```

    and

    ```typescript
    export const cookie = (apiKey: string) => new CookiePlugin(apiKey);
    ```

    But `EdwinConfig` doesn't define `cookieApiKey?: string`. This means the CookiePlugin only works if you configure it via env variables (which are not optional). So you have to declare a `cookieApiKey` parameter in `EdwinConfig` in `src/client/edwin.ts` and pass it to `cookie(config.cookieApiKey)`

    **Problem:**  The code should optionally accept the `cookieApiKey` directly in the config for `Edwin` instead of requiring the user to define it in the environment.
    **Solution:** Add  `cookieApiKey?: string;` to `EdwinConfig` and then change the `cookie` initialization to:

    ```typescript
           if (config.cookieApiKey || process.env.COOKIE_API_KEY) {
                this.plugins.cookie = cookie(config.cookieApiKey ?? process.env.COOKIE_API_KEY!);
            }
    ```

4.  **Inconsistent handling of `amount` in `MeteoraPlugin` addLiquidity schema definition**:

    ```typescript
               schema: z.object({
                    amount: z.number().positive(),
                    amountB: z.number().positive(),
                    poolAddress: z.string().min(1),
                    rangeInterval: z.number().optional(),
                }),
    ```

    and inside `meteoraProtocol.ts` we have:

    ```typescript
    export interface AddLiquidityParameters {
        poolAddress?: string;
        amount: string;
        amountB: string;
        rangeInterval?: number;
    }
    ```

    **Problem:**  Again, as in previous case, the type in the plugin does not match the type in the Protocol.

    **Solution:**  Must be fixed for consistency.
```

## Readme vs Code Report
```markdown
## Analysis of Edwin SDK Documentation vs. Codebase Implementation

This document analyzes the extent to which the Edwin SDK documentation is implemented in the provided codebase, highlighting missing or unimplemented features.

### Implemented Features

*   **Installation:** The `pnpm install edwin-sdk` command is mentioned in the documentation. The codebase includes a `tsup.config.ts` file, indicating the project is set up for packaging and distribution as an SDK (likely through a package manager like `npm` or `pnpm`).
*   **Lending/Borrowing Operations:** The documentation mentions lending/borrowing operations. The codebase contains an `AaveService` and `AavePlugin` (in `src/plugins/aave`), implying implementation of lending/borrowing using the Aave protocol.
*   **Liquidity Provision:** The documentation lists liquidity provision as a feature. The codebase includes `UniswapPlugin`, `UniswapProtocol` (in `src/plugins/uniswap`) and `MeteoraProtocol`, `MeteoraPlugin` (in `src/plugins/meteora`), indicating that liquidity provision is implemented via Uniswap and Meteora protocols.
*   **Cross-Chain Support:** While the documentation mentions cross-chain support, the code shows support for both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains and Solana, using `EdwinEVMWallet` and `EdwinSolanaWallet`. The plugins also seem to be split between supporting EVM and Solana chains.
*   **Type-Safe Protocol Interactions:** The codebase is written in TypeScript, suggesting a focus on type safety.  The use of Zod schemas in plugin definitions (e.g., `src/plugins/aave/aavePlugin.ts`) further reinforces type safety when interacting with protocols.
*   **AI-Friendly Templates:** While the phrase "AI-friendly templates" isn't directly reflected in specific files, the overall design of having tools with schemas and descriptions hints at making the SDK easier for AI agents to use. The `examples/cli-chat-agent/chat-agent.ts` shows how the SDK can be used with Langchain for building a chat agent.
*   **Wallets:** The `EdwinEVMWallet` and `EdwinSolanaWallet` classes (in `src/core/wallets`) provide wallet functionality for interacting with EVM and Solana chains, respectively. They implement methods like `getAddress()` and `getBalance()`.
*   **Plugins:** The codebase utilizes a plugin architecture (e.g., `src/plugins/aave`, `src/plugins/uniswap`).  The `EdwinPlugin` abstract class and its implementations demonstrate a modular approach to integrating with different DeFi protocols.
*   **Tools:** The `EdwinTool` interface (in `src/core/types/edwinTool.ts`) defines a standard structure for tools within the Edwin SDK, including a name, description, schema, and execution function.
*   **Configuration:** The `EdwinConfig` interface (in `src/client/edwin.ts`) allows configuring the Edwin SDK with private keys and plugins. The `Edwin` class (also in `src/client/edwin.ts`) uses this configuration to initialize wallets and plugins.
*   **Error Handling:**  The codebase includes custom error classes, such as `InsufficientBalanceError` (in `src/errors.ts`) and `MeteoraStatisticalBugError` (in `src/plugins/meteora/errors.ts`).  These classes provide specific error information for different scenarios.
*   **Logging:** The codebase uses `winston` for logging through the `edwinLogger` utility (in `src/utils/logger.ts`).
*   **Utilities:** Includes utility functions such as `safeJsonStringify` for handling `BigInt` in JSON serialization and `withRetry` for retrying operations.
*   **Cookie Plugin:** Implemented for interacting with the Cookie API (`src/plugins/cookie`).
*    **EOracle Plugin:** Implemented for interacting with the EOracle API (`src/plugins/eoracle`).
*   **Story Protocol Plugin:** Implemented for interacting with the Story Protocol (`src/plugins/storyprotocol`).
*   **Jupiter Plugin:** Implemented for using the Jupiter swap aggregator on Solana (`src/plugins/jupiter`).
*   **Lulo Plugin:** Implemented for interacting with Lulo.fi on Solana (`src/plugins/lulo`).
*   **Lido Plugin:** Implemented for interacting with Lido on EVM chains (`src/plugins/lido`).
*   **Uniswap Plugin:** Implemented for interacting with Uniswap on EVM chains (`src/plugins/uniswap`).
*   **Meteora Plugin:** Implemented for interacting with Meteora on Solana (`src/plugins/meteora`).

### Missing/Unimplemented Features

*   **Detailed Protocol Operations:** The documentation lacks specifics on the range of protocols fully supported. For example, while Aave and Uniswap are mentioned, the range of operations (e.g., repaying loans, claiming rewards) is not exhaustive and some are explicitly marked as `Not implemented`.
*   **Complete Cross-Chain Implementation:** The documentation states cross-chain support, but the details are vague. The level of abstraction for truly cross-chain operations (e.g., bridging assets) is not evident in the code. The plugins are generally chain-specific.
*   **Aave Withdraw Functionality:** In `src/plugins/aave/aaveService.ts`, the `withdraw` function is explicitly marked as "Not implemented".
*   **Lido Stake/Unstake/ClaimRewards Functionality:** In `src/plugins/lido/lidoProtocol.ts`, the `stake`, `unstake` and `claimRewards` functions are explicitly marked as "Not implemented".
*   **Uniswap Functions:** In `src/plugins/uniswap/uniswapProtocol.ts`, the `swap`, `addLiquidity`, `removeLiquidity` functions are explicitly marked as "Not implemented".
*   **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**  While some error handling exists, a comprehensive strategy for handling all potential errors and edge cases in DeFi interactions is not apparent. Specific error handling for blockchain reverts, slippage, and other common DeFi issues is not consistently present.
*   **Security Considerations:** The documentation doesn't explicitly highlight security best practices, such as key management, transaction signing, and protection against common DeFi exploits.
*   **Custom RPC Support:** While `EdwinEVMWallet` allows specifying custom RPC URLs, the documentation doesn't explicitly explain how to use this feature.
*   **Configuration of Plugins:** The `EdwinConfig` allows specifying plugins to load, but the documentation doesn't explain how to configure the behavior of individual plugins (e.g., setting slippage tolerance for Uniswap).

### Summary

The Edwin SDK codebase implements a significant portion of the features outlined in the documentation, particularly concerning protocol integrations, wallet abstraction, and a plugin-based architecture. However, some key functionalities are incomplete or missing, such as Aave Withdraw functionality and the implementation of all basic functions for Uniswap and Lido plugins.  Further development is needed to fully realize the promise of a comprehensive and secure DeFAI layer.

## Story Implementation Report
```markdown
# Story Protocol Implementation Report

This report analyzes the Edwin project's codebase to assess the implementation of the Story Protocol, referencing the provided documentation and tutorial.

## Overview

The Edwin project aims to provide a framework for interacting with various blockchain protocols, offering a set of tools for managing digital assets and performing actions on different chains.  It uses a plugin architecture for modularity. The `storyprotocol` plugin aims to integrate functionality related to IP asset management on the Story Protocol.

## Features Implemented

Based on the documentation, the following Story Protocol features appear to be implemented in the Edwin project:

*   **IP Asset Registration:** The plugin includes a `registerIPAsset` tool that aims to register an IP asset.
*   **Attaching Terms to IP Asset:** There is an `attachTerms` tool implemented to attach licensing terms.
*   **Minting License Token:** The plugin has a `mintLicenseToken` tool.
*   **Registering Derivative IP Asset:** A `registerDerivative` tool is present.
*   **Paying Royalty to IP Asset:** The `payIPAsset` tool aims to pay royalties.
*   **Claiming Revenue from IP Asset:** The `claimRevenue` tool is present.

## Implementation Quality

The implementation quality is questionable. Here's a breakdown:

*   **`StoryProtocolService` Class:** This class encapsulates the interaction with the Story Protocol. However, the current implementation reveals issues:

    *   **Hardcoded values:** The service uses hardcoded NFT contract addresses (loaded from env variables) and a hardcoded token ID (BigInt(1)) for registration, which severely limits its usability.
    *   **Mock Client:** The most concerning issue is the mock `client` implementation, as it is explicitly a placeholder. The `registerIpAndAttachPilTerms` and `registerDerivativeIp` functions in `StoryProtocolService` return empty results with empty `txHash` values. This mock implementation defeats the whole purpose of using Story Protocol.
         ```typescript
            this.client = {
                ipAsset: {
                    registerIpAndAttachPilTerms: async () => ({ ipId: '', txHash: '', licenseTermsIds: [] }),
                    registerDerivativeIp: async () => ({ ipId: '', txHash: '' }),
                },
                royalty: {
                    payRoyaltyOnBehalf: async () => ({ txHash: '' }),
                    claimAllRevenue: async () => ({ claimedTokens: [] }),
                },
            } as unknown as StoryClient;
         ```
    *   **Metadata Upload:** The metadata handling seems incomplete. While there's an attempt to "Upload metadata to IPFS", the actual implementation is stubbed with `test-uri` values.
    *   **Simplified Logic:**  The service contains simplified logic, such as directly returning 'license-token-id' in `mintLicenseToken`.
    *   **Missing features:** The implementation of `DisputeModule` is completely missing.

*   **Tool Parameters:** The `parameters.ts` defines the structures of the Story Protocol tools, but the values that are used are mainly hardcoded to simple or empty values, which is a sign of non-ideal implementation.
*    **Not using SPG**: The codebase's `StoryProtocolService` doesn't seem to use SPG (Story Protocol Gateway) even though it is listed as one of the main features of the Story Protocol.

## Codebase Quality

*   **Incomplete Implementation:** The most significant issue is the incomplete nature of the `StoryProtocolService`.  The mock client makes the plugin essentially non-functional.
*   **Missing Error Handling:**  The code lacks robust error handling, especially around blockchain interactions.
*   **Hardcoded Values:**  The reliance on hardcoded values (token IDs, contract addresses) reduces the plugin's flexibility and real-world applicability.
*   **Lack of Documentation:** Although type definitions are provided, inline code documentation within `StoryProtocolService` is limited.

## Recommendations

*   **Implement the Story Protocol SDK:** The first priority is to replace the mock `client` with a proper initialization and utilization of the `@story-protocol/core-sdk`.
*   **Implement Error Handling:** Add proper error handling, especially for blockchain transactions and API calls. Handle potential exceptions and provide informative error messages.
*   **Dynamic Metadata Handling:** Implement a proper mechanism for creating and uploading IP and NFT metadata to IPFS, allowing users to specify the relevant information.
*   **Implement Dispute Module:** add support for raising disputes by fully implementing the `DisputeModule`.
*   **Implement SPG**: The plugin should consider implementing SPG to combine multiple operations into a single transaction.
*   **Configuration:** Use environment variables or configuration files to manage contract addresses, API keys, and other parameters, making the plugin more configurable.
*   **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the plugin functions correctly and handles various scenarios.  The tests should cover successful operations, error conditions, and edge cases.
*   **Proper Structs:**  Implement IPAsset registration with the correct struct.

## Conclusion

The `storyprotocol` plugin in the Edwin project demonstrates an *attempt* to integrate with the Story Protocol. However, the current implementation is incomplete and of low quality due to the mock client, hardcoded values, and missing features.  Significant work is required to create a functional and reliable Story Protocol integration within the Edwin framework.
