### Identified Bug(s)

The following is the problematic code in `streamlit_app.py`:

```python
with col1:
    if st.session_state.current_step > 0:
        if st.button("Previous Step"):
            st.session_state.stepper.prev_step()
            st.session_state.current_step = st.session_state.stepper.current_step

with col3:
    if st.session_state.current_step < len(st.session_state.stepper.steps) - 1:
        if st.button("Next Step"):
            st.session_state.stepper.next_step()
            st.session_state.current_step = st.session_state.stepper.current_step
```

**Problem:**

The `next_step` and `prev_step` functions should directly modify `st.session_state.current_step` for Streamlit's state management to function correctly.  The `StepperBar` class is used to represent the stepper, but the code is trying to use `st.session_state.stepper.next_step()` and `st.session_state.stepper.prev_step()` which do not trigger a re-render, because StepperBar is not stored in st.session_state. Additionally, the if condition uses the length of `st.session_state.stepper.steps` while using `next_step()` which modifies `st.session_state.current_step`.

## Story Implementation Report
```markdown
## Story Protocol Implementation Report

This report analyzes the codebase provided, focusing on the implementation of features related to the Story Protocol. The analysis considers the proper importing of "@story-protocol/core-sdk", as well as the implementation of key functionalities based on the provided documentation and tutorial.

### Codebase Overview

The project consists of a Streamlit application designed to facilitate the creation, configuration, and deployment of agent swarms following the ATCP/IP architecture. The application integrates with the Story Protocol to manage IP assets, licenses, and negotiations.

### Story Protocol Features Implemented

Based on the provided documentation, the following Story Protocol features appear to be implemented in the codebase:

*   **IP Asset Registration:** The application includes functionality to register IP assets using the `RegisterIPAsset` tool. It also uses SPG through  `mintAndRegisterIpAssetWithPilTerms`
*   **Licensing Module:** The application allows creating and attaching license terms using the `CreateLicenseTerms` and `AttachLicenseTerms` tools.
*   **Minting License Tokens:** The application uses the `MintLicenseToken` tool to mint license tokens for IP assets.
*   **Querying IP Assets:** The `QueryStoryIPAssets` tool is used to retrieve and display a list of IP assets owned by a specific address.
*   **Getting IP Asset Details:** The application uses the `GetIPAssetDetails` tool to display detailed information about a selected IP asset.
*   **Dispute Module:** The application integrates the Dispute Module to handle disputes related to IP Assets, utilizing the `DisputeIPAsset` tool.
*   **Claim Royalty:** The application facilitates claiming royalties for IP assets using the `ClaimRoyalty` tool.

### Quality of Implementation

The implementation quality varies across the different features. Here's a breakdown:

*   **IP Asset Registration:** The `RegisterIPAsset` tool seems to implement the basic registration functionality. However, it uses a mock implementation for simplicity, generating a fake IP asset ID and transaction hash instead of interacting with the actual Story Protocol contracts.

    - The tutorial uses the actual SDK functions, showing how to properly implement this feature. The Streamlit application could benefit from this approach.
*   **Licensing Module:** The `CreateLicenseTerms` and `AttachLicenseTerms` tools also use mock implementations, generating fake license terms IDs and transaction results.

    - Similarly to IP Asset Registration, the tutorial showcases the correct way to integrate with the Story Protocol's Licensing Module, which the streamlit app does not do.
*   **Minting License Tokens:** The `MintLicenseToken` tool employs a similar mock implementation.
*   **Querying IP Assets:** The `QueryStoryIPAssets` tool interacts with the Story Protocol API to retrieve IP assets but relies on the API returning mock data for demonstration purposes.
*   **Getting IP Asset Details:** Similar to querying, the `GetIPAssetDetails` tool interacts with the Story Protocol API, falling back to local mock data if the API call fails.
*   **Dispute Module:**  The `DisputeIPAsset` tool demonstrates a detailed process of interacting with the Dispute Module. It includes validation steps such as checking the liveness period, and it even attempts to convert the CID to a hash format. However, it is still a mock implementation as it doesn't actually submit the transaction.
*   **Claim Royalty:** The `ClaimRoyalty` tool presents a mock implementation for claiming royalties, generating a random royalty amount.

**General Observations:**

*   **Mock Implementations:** The primary concern is the extensive use of mock implementations. While suitable for a demonstration application, these mocks prevent actual interaction with the Story Protocol.
*   **Lack of Error Handling:** Although some try-except blocks are present, more robust error handling could improve the application's reliability. Specifically, the parsing of `forward` function results into JSON should be wrapped in try-except blocks.
*   **Inconsistent Network Usage:** The `CreateLicenseTerms` tool attempts to initialize the StoryProtocolAPI with the selected network, which is a good practice. However, this is not consistently applied across all tools.
*   **SPG Use:** The SPG contracts have not been fully explored within the Streamlit Application.
*   **Story Protocol SDK:** The project imports "@story-protocol/core-sdk" for type definitions (e.g., `IpMetadata`). However, it does **not** use the SDK for interacting with the Story Protocol contracts. This is a major deviation from the recommended approach, as the SDK provides a more convenient and reliable way to interact with the protocol. The scripts provided in the documentation do use the SDK functions.

### Codebase Quality Around Story Protocol

The codebase demonstrates a basic understanding of the Story Protocol's features and concepts. However, the reliance on mock implementations and the lack of proper SDK integration significantly reduce its quality.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Integrate the Story Protocol SDK:** Replace the mock implementations with actual calls to the Story Protocol SDK. This will enable real interaction with the protocol and provide a more accurate representation of its capabilities.
*   **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Add comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage potential issues, such as failed API calls, invalid input data, and transaction errors.
*   **Follow the documentation:** Refer to the provided documentation and tutorials to ensure proper implementation of the Story Protocol features.
*   **Use Constants and Helper Functions:** Encapsulate contract addresses and common operations in constants and helper functions to improve code readability and maintainability.
*   **Improve Security:** Implement security best practices, such as input validation and access control, to protect against potential vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion

The project has laid a foundation for integrating with the Story Protocol, but significant improvements are needed to achieve a high-quality implementation. By addressing the recommendations outlined above, the project can become a valuable tool for developers looking to build applications on the Story Protocol.
