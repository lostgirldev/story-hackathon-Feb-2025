## Story Protocol Implementation Report for AlphaSwarm

This report analyzes the AlphaSwarm codebase to determine the extent and quality of its Story Protocol implementation.

### 1. Feature Implementation

Based on the provided codebase and documentation, here's a breakdown of potential Story Protocol features that *could* be implemented and what *is* actually implemented:

| Story Protocol Feature                                 | Implemented? | Notes                                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :-----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Features**                                        |               |                                                                                                                                                               |
| IP Asset Registration                                  |      No       | No direct usage of `@story-protocol/core-sdk`'s `register()` or `mintAndRegisterIp()` for IP Asset Registration. The code focuses on trading and analysis. |
| Programmable IP Licenses (PIL)                         |      No       | There's no evidence of using `attachLicenseTerms()` to manage on-chain enforceable licenses.                                                                 |
| License Tokens                                         |      No       | Minting of license tokens is not implemented.                                                                                                               |
| Royalty Module                                         |      No       | Royalty payments or derivative registration functionality from the Story Protocol SDK are missing.                                                              |
| Dispute Module                                         |      No       | The codebase doesn't contain any implementation related to raising disputes.                                                                                 |

| Metadata Standard                                      |      No       | IP Metadata Standard is not implemented in the current code base.                                                                                             |
| Story Protocol Gateway (SPG)                           |      No       | The SPG is not implemented in the current code base.                                                                                                          |

| Importing `@story-protocol/core-sdk`               |      No       | The core SDK isn't imported or used anywhere in the codebase.                                                                                                   |

### 2. Implementation Quality

Since there is no direct implementation of Story Protocol features, the question of implementation quality is moot.  The codebase doesn't leverage Story Protocol's on-chain IP management capabilities.

### 3. Codebase Quality Around Story Protocol

The codebase doesn't currently interact with the Story Protocol.  Therefore, there is no quality to assess in that regard. The code appears well-structured for its intended purpose (agent-based trading and analysis), but it operates independently of the Story Protocol.
