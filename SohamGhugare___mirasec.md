### Bug Report

The codebase has the following issues:

1.  **Conflicting Function Names in `sec.py`:**
    The file `sec.py` contains two functions with the same name `search_filings`. This will cause the latter definition to override the former, which means that the `@tool` decorated function for searching filings by date range and limit will be overwritten by the simulated filing search function.

    ```python
    # sec.py
    @tool
    def search_filings(ticker: str, start_date: str, end_date: str, limit: int = 3) -> list:
        """
        Search and retrieve SEC 10-K filings for a given company.
        """
        # ... implementation ...

    def search_filings(ticker: str) -> str:
        """
        Simulated SEC filing search function.
        """
        # ... placeholder implementation ...
    ```

    **Problem:** Python allows function overloading, however, when two functions have the exact same signature, only the last defined function will be available.  This means the `search_filings` function decorated with `@tool` will never be used, breaking the intended functionality of fetching real SEC filings. In `main.py`, the `_create_analysis_prompt` method utilizes only the simulated `search_filings` method, rendering `start_date`, `end_date`, and `limit` parameters useless.

**Resolution:**
Rename either of the `search_filings` functions to resolve the naming conflict.  A good solution would be to rename the simulated function to `simulate_search_filings`

```python
    # sec.py
    @tool
    def search_filings(ticker: str, start_date: str, end_date: str, limit: int = 3) -> list:
        """
        Search and retrieve SEC 10-K filings for a given company.
        """
        # ... implementation ...

    def simulate_search_filings(ticker: str) -> str:
        """
        Simulated SEC filing search function.
        """
        # ... placeholder implementation ...
```


## Readme vs Code Report

## Analysis of Documentation vs. Codebase

Here's an analysis of the documentation against the provided codebase, highlighting implemented, partially implemented, and missing features:

**Implemented Features:**

*   **Advanced Language Model Integration**: The `FinancialAnalysisClient` uses `mira_network.MiraClient` to interact with a language model, specified via the `model` parameter (defaults to "gpt-4o"), aligning with the documentation's emphasis on leveraging Mira's advanced models.

*   **Dual Response Modes (Synchronous and Streaming)**:  The `FinancialAnalysisClient` class provides both `analyze_stock()` for synchronous (complete report) analysis and `analyze_stock_stream()` for streaming analysis, as described in the documentation.

*   **Basic Usage Examples**: The `main.py` script includes example implementations for both `analyze_stock` (Regular analysis) and `analyze_stock_stream` (Streaming Analysis) which are similar to the documentation's "Basic Analysis" and "Streaming Analysis" examples.

*   **Installation**: The `pip install` instructions are present and correct for the given code.

**Partially Implemented Features:**

*   **SEC Filing Analysis**:  The `sec.py` file contains code to search and retrieve SEC filings. The `search_filings` function in `sec.py` has two different implementations. One is a simplified version that returns placeholder data. The other attempts to use `sec-api` to retrieve and parse 10-K filings, including HTML cleaning using BeautifulSoup.  However, the `search_filings` function used in `main.py` is the placeholder version, meaning it doesn't perform a *real* SEC filing analysis. The parsing of `sec-api`'s content is partially implemented, cleaning HTML and extracting text, but more robust parsing may be needed for production use.

*   **Structured Analysis Framework**: The `_create_analysis_prompt` method in `FinancialAnalysisClient` outlines a structured analysis framework focusing on financial performance trends, risk factors, management's discussion, market conditions, and company strategy.  However, because `search_filings` only returns dummy data, the prompt lacks real data to fulfill the prompt.

*   **API Key Setup**: The documentation mentions setting up environment variables (`MIRA_API_KEY`, `SEC_API_KEY`). While the code in `sec.py` does load environment variables using `dotenv`, `main.py` initializes `FinancialAnalysisClient` with a hardcoded `"your-api-key"` placeholder, which directly violates the principle of storing API keys in environment variables.

*   **Custom Analysis Parameters**:  The documentation mentions "Adjustable date ranges for historical analysis."  The `get_date_range` function in `main.py` calculates a date range (last 2 years), but this range is not exposed as a configurable parameter to the `analyze_stock` or `analyze_stock_stream` methods, nor is it used in conjunction with the implemented `sec-api` to provide specific reports within that date range. The actual `search_filings` called in `main.py` does not utilize any date ranges at all.

**Missing Features:**

*   **Historical Data Analysis and Key Metrics Extraction**: The `search_filings` function returns hardcoded string as SEC filling data. Therefore, the model cannot perform a historical data analysis and key metrics extraction, as described in the documentation.

*   **Error Handling**: While the documentation highlights the importance of error handling, the provided code only includes basic `try...except` blocks in `sec.py` to catch potential issues during filing downloads.  More comprehensive error handling, particularly for API connection issues, rate limiting, and invalid responses within the `FinancialAnalysisClient`, is absent. The documentation suggests handling rate limits gracefully, but no rate limiting logic is implemented in the provided code.

*   **Data Validation**:  The documentation mentions verifying SEC filing data and validating model responses.  No data validation is implemented in the provided code.

*   **Rate Limiting and API Usage Monitoring:** The documentation mentions rate limiting and API usage monitoring, but this functionality is not implemented in the provided code.

*   **Flexible Prompt Engineering**: While the `_create_analysis_prompt` exists, there is no way to customize the prompt through the `FinancialAnalysisClient` methods, which limits the flexibility of the analysis.

*   **Multiple Filing Type Support:** `sec.py` is hardcoded to only search for `10-K` filings.

## Story Implementation Report
```markdown
## Story Protocol Implementation Report

This report analyzes the provided codebase for its implementation of the Story Protocol, based on the provided documentation and tutorial.

**Overall Assessment:**

The codebase does **not** implement any features of the Story Protocol. The primary reason is the complete absence of the `@story-protocol/core-sdk` import, which is fundamental for interacting with the protocol.  The code focuses on retrieving and analyzing SEC filings, which are completely unrelated to on-chain IP asset management and licensing provided by Story Protocol.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

Here's a breakdown of the key Story Protocol features and whether they are implemented in the codebase:

*   **IP Asset Registration:** Not Implemented. There are no calls to `client.ipAsset.register()` or similar functions. The project deals with financial information from SEC filings, not on-chain IP asset registration.
*   **Programmable IP Licenses (PIL):** Not Implemented. No code relating to attaching or managing licenses. No calls to `client.license.attachLicenseTerms()`, `client.license.registerPILTerms()`, etc.
*   **License Tokens:** Not Implemented.  No minting or handling of license tokens.
*   **Royalty Module:** Not Implemented. No royalty payments or revenue claims are found.
*   **Dispute Module:** Not Implemented. No dispute raising functionality.
*   **Grouping Module:** Not Implemented.
*   **Hooks:** Not Implemented.
*   **Metadata Standard:** Not Implemented. While the code handles data, it's financial data extracted from SEC filings, not IP asset metadata conforming to the Story Protocol standard.  No use of `IpMetadata` from the SDK.
*   **Story Protocol Gateway (SPG):** Not Implemented.
*   **Access Control:** Not Implemented.
*   **Revenue Tokens:** Not Implemented.
*   **IP Royalty Vault:** Not Implemented.
*   **Story Network:** The codebase interacts with an LLM and the SEC database, not the Story Network blockchain.

**Codebase Quality Around Story Protocol:**

Since there's no implementation of Story Protocol, the codebase quality with respect to it is essentially non-existent.  The code is well-structured for its intended purpose (financial analysis using SEC filings) but completely unrelated to the on-chain IP management features of Story Protocol.

**Specific Observations:**

*   **Incorrect Use of Concepts:**  The code doesn't use any of the Story Protocol's core concepts (IP Assets, IP Accounts, License Tokens, etc.).

**Recommendations:**

To integrate Story Protocol, the following steps are necessary:

1.  **Install the SDK:**  `npm install @story-protocol/core-sdk` or `yarn add @story-protocol/core-sdk`
2.  **Import necessary modules:**  `import { StoryClient, StoryConfig } from '@story-protocol/core-sdk'`
3.  **Configure the SDK:**  Initialize the `StoryClient` with your account, RPC provider, and chain ID.
4.  **Implement desired features:**  Use the SDK functions to register IP assets, attach licenses, manage royalties, etc.

**Conclusion:**

The provided codebase is unrelated to the Story Protocol. It focuses on a different problem domain (financial analysis) and lacks the necessary imports and implementations to interact with the protocol.  To leverage the Story Protocol, significant modifications are required to incorporate the SDK and implement the desired IP management features.
