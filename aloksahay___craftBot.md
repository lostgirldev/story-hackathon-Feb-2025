### Analysis of Codebase

The codebase has several potential issues:

1.  **Incorrect Initialization of `VideoDataManager` in `TrackBodyPoseView`:**

    ```swift
    private let videoDataManager = VideoDataManager(nillionCluster: [:]) // Empty dictionary as placeholder for now
    ```

    *   **Problem:** The `VideoDataManager` initializer expects an argument, `nillionCluster`, which is of type `Any`. However, the code is passing an empty dictionary `[:]` as a placeholder. This argument is not used and it should be removed. The  `VideoDataManager`  should be initialized without the need of cluster parameter.
    *   **Fix:** Modify the  `VideoDataManager`  initializer to accept no parameters instead, or provide appropriate `nillionCluster` parameter.

2.  **Potential Force Unwrapping in `UploadVideoRecord`:**

    ```swift
    let jsonData = try! JSONEncoder().encode(recordingData)
    let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)!
    ```

    *   **Problem:** The force unwrapping `try!` and `!` after the `String` initializer can cause a crash if the encoding fails. JSON encoding and string conversion may fail.
    *   **Fix:** Use `try` with proper error handling and optional binding for string conversion.

    ```swift
    do {
        let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(recordingData)
        if let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8) {
            self.recording_data = RecordingDataAllot(allot: jsonString)
        } else {
            // Handle the error, e.g., by throwing an error or returning nil
            throw NillionError.encodingError
        }
    } catch {
        // Handle the error
        print("Error encoding RecordingData to JSON: \(error)")
        throw error // Or handle the error as needed
    }
    ```

3.  **Unused `RPC_URL` and `chainID` in `Web3RPC`:**

    ```swift
    private var chainID = 1
    private var RPC_URL = ""
    
    init?(user: Web3AuthState){
        self.user = user
        do{
            client = EthereumHttpClient(url: URL(string: RPC_URL)!, network: .fromString(String(chainID)))
            account = try EthereumAccount(keyStorage: user as EthereumSingleKeyStorageProtocol )
            address = account.address
        } catch {
             return nil
        }
    }
    ```

    *   **Problem:** `RPC_URL` is initialized as an empty string, causing `EthereumHttpClient` to initialize with empty URL. `chainID` also seems hardcoded.
    *   **Fix:** The values should be configurable from environment variables or some configuration.

4.  **Incorrect Gas calculation in `Web3RPC.transferAsset`:**
    ```swift
    func transferAsset(sendTo: String, amount: Double, maxTip: Double, gasLimit: BigUInt = 21000) async throws -> String {
        let gasPrice = try await client.eth_gasPrice()
        let maxTipInGwie = BigUInt(Utils.toEther(Gwie: BigUInt(amount)))
        let totalGas = gasPrice + maxTipInGwie
        let amtInGwie = Utils.toWei(ether: amount)
        let nonce = try await client.eth_getTransactionCount(address: address, block: .Latest)
        let transaction = EthereumTransaction(from: address, to: EthereumAddress(sendTo), value: amtInGwie, data: Data(), nonce: nonce + 1, gasPrice: totalGas, gasLimit: gasLimit, chainId: chainID)
        let signed = try account.sign(transaction: transaction)
        let val = try await client.eth_sendRawTransaction(signed.transaction, withAccount: account)
        return val
    }
    ```
    *  **Problem:** The `maxTipInGwie` calculates Ether from amount, but amount is in Double, it should convert the maxTip Double parameter to BigUInt for maxPriorityFeePerGas. The `totalGas` should be gasPrice + maxTipInGwie, which is incorrect. Also, `nonce` should not plus 1.
    *  **Fix:** It should pass `maxPriorityFeePerGas` separately, and get gasLimit with web3 library automatically instead of hardcode it.

5.  **`VideoDataManager` init with `nillionCluster` parameter:**

    ```swift
    init(nillionCluster: Any) {
        self.nillion = NillionWrapper()
    }
    ```

    *   **Problem:** The `nillionCluster` parameter does not get used anywhere in the init function.
    *   **Fix:** The code should be `init()` instead of `init(nillionCluster: Any)`

6.  **`UploadVideoRecord` struct may contains bugs:**
    ```swift
    struct UploadVideoRecord: Codable {
        let _id: String
        let wallet_address: String
        let video_cid: String
        let chunk_index: Int
        let total_chunks: Int
        let recording_data: RecordingDataAllot
        
        struct RecordingDataAllot: Codable {
            let allot: String
            
            enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
                case allot = "$allot"
            }
        }
        
        init(recordingData: RecordingData, walletAddress: String, videoCID: String, chunkIndex: Int = 0, totalChunks: Int = 1) {
            self._id = UUID().uuidString
            self.wallet_address = walletAddress
            self.video_cid = videoCID
            self.chunk_index = chunkIndex
            self.total_chunks = totalChunks
            
            // Encode the recording data to a string
            let jsonData = try! JSONEncoder().encode(recordingData)
            let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)!
            self.recording_data = RecordingDataAllot(allot: jsonString)
        }
    }
    ```
    *   **Problem:** `UploadVideoRecord` struct uploads all data at once, without chunks.
    *   **Fix:** `chunkIndex` and `totalChunks` should be implemented with chunk logic.

## Readme vs Code Report
```markdown
## Analysis of CraftBot Codebase vs. Documentation

The provided documentation is extremely minimal, consisting only of the project name and a brief description:

```
# craftBot
Story Hackathon ETHDenver 2025
```

Given this limited documentation, here's an analysis of its implementation within the codebase:

**Implemented Aspects:**

*   **Project Name:** The project name "craftBot" is implicitly implemented as it is the name used for the project directory, files and is the overall scope of the code.

*   **Story Hackathon ETHDenver 2025:** While this is a contextual description, the codebase shows evidence of features that would align to be suitable for a Hackathon project. This includes camera access, AI pose tracking, backend interactions, and Web3 authentication. This is not directly implemented by the code, but can be seen as an overall goal of the codebase.

**Missing/Not Implemented Aspects:**

Given that the documentation lacks any details beyond the project name, *everything* else in the codebase can be considered "not implemented" with respect to the documentation. Specifically:

*   **Functionality Details:** There's no specification of features like:
    *   Video Recording/Uploading
    *   Pose Tracking
    *   Nillion Integration (encryption/decryption)
    *   Web3 Authentication
    *   Backend communication

*   **Architecture:** No description of the project's architecture, design patterns, or component interactions.

*   **Usage Instructions:**  No instructions on how to build, run, or use the application.

*   **API Documentation:** No documentation for the API endpoints used.

*   **Error Handling:** No documentation of the error handling strategies.

*   **Configuration:** No information on environment variables or configuration files.

*   **Security Considerations:**  No documentation on security measures taken.

**Summary:**

The documentation is essentially a title. The codebase, while functional in certain areas, lacks any formal documentation to describe its purpose, usage, or architecture. Therefore, almost the entire codebase remains undocumented relative to the provided README. A proper README would provide an overview of the app, how to build and run it, and what its intended functionality is, along with more information that is mentioned above.

## Story Implementation Report

# Story Protocol Implementation Report for Craft Project

## Overview

This report assesses the Craft project's implementation of the Story Protocol, based on the provided codebase, Story Protocol documentation, and tutorials. The primary focus is on identifying implemented features, evaluating their implementation quality, and providing a general assessment of the codebase's utilization of the Story Protocol. Critically, the project uses `NillionWrapper.swift` and other calls for encryption and does not import or use "@story-protocol/core-sdk". This means that there are currently no features that are actually implemented from the story protocol.

## Findings

### 1. Implemented Story Protocol Features

Based on the provided code, **none** of the features from the Story Protocol are implemented. The codebase does not import `@story-protocol/core-sdk` nor does it seem to utilize it based on the method names and parameters. The project focuses more on using QuickPose SDK and Nillion for Video management and AI interaction. There are no instances of calls to Story Protocol's core functionalities like:

*   IP Asset Registration
*   Programmable IP Licenses (PIL)
*   License Tokens
*   Royalty Module
*   Dispute Module
*   Grouping Module
*   Metadata Standard
*   Hooks and Access Control

**Instead, there's an extensive use of Nillion's encryption methods and a separate backend**, which suggests the project is experimenting with a custom IP management solution rather than integrating with Story Protocol at this stage.

### 2. Implementation Quality

Since there is no integration with the Story Protocol the implementation quality is irrelevent.

### 3. Codebase Quality Regarding Story Protocol

The codebase lacks any integration with the Story Protocol.

**Observations:**

*   **No `@story-protocol/core-sdk` Imports:** This is the most immediate indicator that the project isn't directly using the Story Protocol's SDK.
*   **Nillion Integration:** The `NillionWrapper` class handles encryption and decryption, suggesting an alternative approach to IP protection.
*   **Custom Backend:** The use of API calls to a specified base URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.112:3000`) indicates that core IP management logic (which Story Protocol would provide) is likely handled by a custom backend server.

### 4. Recommendations

Given the current lack of integration, several steps would be necessary to adopt the Story Protocol:

1.  **Install `@story-protocol/core-sdk`:** Add the Story Protocol SDK to the project using a package manager like npm or yarn if the codebase were javascript or typescript, swift's equivalent.
2.  **Implement IP Asset Registration:** Use the SDK's `register()` or `mintAndRegisterIp()` methods to register videos as IP Assets on the Story Protocol.
3.  **Consider PIL Integration:** Explore attaching Programmable IP Licenses to define usage rights for the videos.
4.  **Implement Royalty and Dispute Handling (Optional):** If relevant, implement royalty distribution and dispute resolution mechanisms using the SDK's corresponding methods.
5.  **Metadata Enrichment:** Ensure IP Assets include comprehensive metadata following the Story Protocol's metadata standard.

## Conclusion

The Craft project, in its current state, does not utilize the Story Protocol. The codebase is structured around Nillion for encryption and a custom backend server for core logic. To integrate with Story Protocol, the project would need to incorporate the SDK and implement core functionalities like IP asset registration, licensing, and royalty management.
