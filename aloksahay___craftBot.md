# Story Protocol Implementation Report for Craft Project

## Overview

This report assesses the Craft project's implementation of the Story Protocol, based on the provided codebase, Story Protocol documentation, and tutorials. The primary focus is on identifying implemented features, evaluating their implementation quality, and providing a general assessment of the codebase's utilization of the Story Protocol. Critically, the project uses `NillionWrapper.swift` and other calls for encryption and does not import or use "@story-protocol/core-sdk". This means that there are currently no features that are actually implemented from the story protocol.

## Findings

### 1. Implemented Story Protocol Features

Based on the provided code, **none** of the features from the Story Protocol are implemented. The codebase does not import `@story-protocol/core-sdk` nor does it seem to utilize it based on the method names and parameters. The project focuses more on using QuickPose SDK and Nillion for Video management and AI interaction. There are no instances of calls to Story Protocol's core functionalities like:

*   IP Asset Registration
*   Programmable IP Licenses (PIL)
*   License Tokens
*   Royalty Module
*   Dispute Module
*   Grouping Module
*   Metadata Standard
*   Hooks and Access Control

**Instead, there's an extensive use of Nillion's encryption methods and a separate backend**, which suggests the project is experimenting with a custom IP management solution rather than integrating with Story Protocol at this stage.

### 2. Implementation Quality

Since there is no integration with the Story Protocol the implementation quality is irrelevent.

### 3. Codebase Quality Regarding Story Protocol

The codebase lacks any integration with the Story Protocol.

**Observations:**

*   **No `@story-protocol/core-sdk` Imports:** This is the most immediate indicator that the project isn't directly using the Story Protocol's SDK.
*   **Nillion Integration:** The `NillionWrapper` class handles encryption and decryption, suggesting an alternative approach to IP protection.
*   **Custom Backend:** The use of API calls to a specified base URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.112:3000`) indicates that core IP management logic (which Story Protocol would provide) is likely handled by a custom backend server.

### 4. Recommendations

Given the current lack of integration, several steps would be necessary to adopt the Story Protocol:

1.  **Install `@story-protocol/core-sdk`:** Add the Story Protocol SDK to the project using a package manager like npm or yarn if the codebase were javascript or typescript, swift's equivalent.
2.  **Implement IP Asset Registration:** Use the SDK's `register()` or `mintAndRegisterIp()` methods to register videos as IP Assets on the Story Protocol.
3.  **Consider PIL Integration:** Explore attaching Programmable IP Licenses to define usage rights for the videos.
4.  **Implement Royalty and Dispute Handling (Optional):** If relevant, implement royalty distribution and dispute resolution mechanisms using the SDK's corresponding methods.
5.  **Metadata Enrichment:** Ensure IP Assets include comprehensive metadata following the Story Protocol's metadata standard.

## Conclusion

The Craft project, in its current state, does not utilize the Story Protocol. The codebase is structured around Nillion for encryption and a custom backend server for core logic. To integrate with Story Protocol, the project would need to incorporate the SDK and implement core functionalities like IP asset registration, licensing, and royalty management.
